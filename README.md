An Excerpt: 
Just like we need to walk, run, lift weights and exercise to keep our muscles strong, playing Sudoku is a way to exercise our brain “muscles.” Some studies have suggested that playing brain games like Sudoku can even improve people’s cognitive abilities. Playing Sudoku isn’t just fun and relaxing – it might help you to develop your attentiveness and concentration skills.

I chose sudoku because it was the game I would play whenever I feel tense and anxious. The focus and attention it requires forced me to slow down and take things one step at a time. And as a person who is easily distracted and has a short attention span, sudoku have had somehow got me occupied for hours. 

# Mondrian Sudoku
A sudoku presented in a museum gallery showcasing the works of 20th century dutch artist, Piet Mondrian; known for his abstract paintings made from squares and rectangles. The grids and colours that Mondrian employed adds a degree of disorientation to the sudoku puzzle, which in turn, commands the player to heighten their focus. 

A diary of cognitive performance.

Practice makes perfect and it's evident when you turn your head around to see just how far you are from where you started. A timer is introduced in this rendition of sudoku to document the progression of the development of attentiveness and concentration. 

PS. Grids are available should one requires it.

# Approach Taken
A preset of numbers representing the puzzle on sudoku (incomplete and completed) was generated from an existing sudoku puzzle online and was used as a data to map it on the Mondrian Sudoku. Everytime a number is placed on the board, a function is called to compare all the current numbers on the board with the completed preset of numbers.

# Possible Future Developments

- Using algorithm to generate mondrian artwork
- Wrongly placed numbers would be highlighted
- A pencil feature to write down possible numbers

# Backlog
- Accessing all levels
- Setting up local storage to record the time taken
- About page to explain the concept
